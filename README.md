# Flappy Bird Clone

This project is a clone of the classic Flappy Bird game with a few enhancements to make the gameplay more forgiving. Unlike the original, the physics has been tweaked a tiny bit to provide a smoother and slightly easier experience. This version does not include an end-of-game scoreboard to track the highest scores, but you are welcome to add that feature if you wish.

## Why This Project?

I created this Flappy Bird clone to:
1. Learn and Practice Game Development: Developing this project allowed me to dive deep into game development concepts using Python and Pygame. As someone who still considers themselves a beginner in Python, this project-based learning, project was an excellent opportunity to understand how games handle rendering, physics, and user input.
2. Enhance Problem-Solving Skills: By tackling the various challenges involved in cloning a popular game, I improved my problem-solving skills and gained experience in debugging and optimizing code.
3. Experiment with Game Physics: Unlike the original Flappy Bird, this version features tweaked physics to provide a more forgiving gameplay experience. This adjustment was a fun way to experiment with game mechanics and understand their impact on the player's experience.
4. Encourage Contributions and Customization: The project is designed to be easily extendable. For example, it doesn't include a high score tracker, but the codebase is structured in a way that makes adding new features straightforward. I encourage others to contribute by adding their own enhancements and features.
4. Showcase My Skills: This project serves as a portfolio piece to demonstrate my skills in Python programming, and game development, and my ability to complete a project from start to finish.

## Features

- Classic Flappy Bird gameplay with modified physics for a more forgiving experience
- Smooth and responsive controls
- Simple and clean graphics
- Easy to understand and modify codebase

## How to Play

- Press the spacebar to make the bird flap its wings and navigate through the pipes.
- Avoid hitting the pipes and the ground to keep flying.
- Try to achieve the highest score possible.

## Customization

- I consider this as a baseline for the game.
- You can even change the whole theme of the game if you want to, but make sure to have the necessary files to change ex. background, icons, etc.
- Feel free to modify the physics to suit your preferences.
- You can add new features, such as an end-of-game scoreboard to track high scores.

## Getting Started

Step 1: Make sure to have Python and Pygame library installed on your PC/Mac/ or Linux device.
Step 2: Clone the project files to this repository.
Step 3: Go to the project directory on your terminal.
Step 4: Use the command python3 main.py to start the game.
Step 5: Happy Playing!
